## Two-Player Math Game

This is a 2-Player math game where players take turn to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is, is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life. 

Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they answer wrong. At the end of every turn the game will output the new scores for both players, so the players know where they stand. 

The game doesn't end until one of the players loses all of their lives. At this point, the game announces who won and what the other player's score is.
